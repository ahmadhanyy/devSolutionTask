# DevSolutionTask

This project is a simple responsive dashboard page made with Angular v20 with modern ipdates like zoneless and standalone components. I used NgRX to handle api calls. The project files was organized as feature first approach.

It was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.1.

## Development server

To start a live server, run this link:

https://ahmadhanyy.github.io/devSolutionTask/

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
